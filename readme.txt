The program converts decimal into binary and vice versa.						
It also supports multi-data type conversion.									
The program inputs data types and binary-decimal values for parameters.			
It recognizes input values automatically whether they are binary or decimal, and converts them into another form.  
It also recognizes several data types and converts each data split in type size.
It uses only standard libraries, so it never needs to link any external libraries.
The solution separated into components performing each part - Bin2Data() and Data2Bin() so it's easy to understand.
